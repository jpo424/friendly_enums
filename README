A module that helps manage the use of enumerations. It constantizes each enum in the file
as to avoid random numbers appearing in code and to keep code using enums understandable.
Each enum is valued as an integer so that it can be used efficiently in db.


# EXAMPLE

module Languages
  
  extend Enum
    define_enum(
    [:spanish,       1,     "Spanish, originated in Spain"],
    [:bamanankan,    2,     "Bamanankan, originated in Mali"],
  )
end

puts Languages::SPANISH
# => 1

puts Languages.description_for(1)
# => Spanish, Originated in Spain
